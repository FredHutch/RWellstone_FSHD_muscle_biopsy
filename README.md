# RWellstone_FSHD_muscle_biopsy

This repository supports the transparent and reproducible analysis for the manuscript "Longitudinal measures of RNA expression and disease activity in FSHD muscle biopsies".  It has two major branches: the main branch is a starndard R package containing RData (`../data/*.rda`) files and scripts (`../inst/scripts/*.R`) used in the manuscript; gh-pages branch discloses a gitbook explaining the details of the analysis along with R codes and shell scripts. 

## Software requirement
